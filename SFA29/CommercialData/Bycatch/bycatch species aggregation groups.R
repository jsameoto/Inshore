# If the SPECCD_ID is NA and it's not in a group, there's a chance the SPECCD_ID was miscoded in the ISDB. 
# Look at the OTIS reports/scans to make sure that the observer actually recorded the species (COMMON) in this list.
# e.g. in 2018, clappers were miscoded as Greenland Cockle.

# But if the observer actually reported the species shown, we need to classify them into the groups manually. Using the code below as a template,
# adjust the COMMON name and GROUP accordingly to assign a GROUP to each record.
